    <h1>Data Analysis Report</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction and Question Identification</h2>
        <p> Our project chooses the data of League of Legend Competitive Matches. This data contains information of players and teams from League of Legends competitive matches. 
            The question that we are interested in is does the average game duration differ significantly between different competitive regions in tier-one professional leagues in 2022? 
            The reader of the website should pay attention to this question because the game duration is important for implementing strategies. 
            Understanding the difference lets people make a more effective decision toward the games.
            There are 149400 rows and 123 columns in this dataset, and columns that are relevant to our questions are ‘gameid’, ‘gamelength’, ‘league’. 
            The gameid column represents the unique identifier to each game. The gamelength column represents how long the game takes. The league in which the game was played.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>We clean the data by only taking a specific list of leagues, since our analysis only wants the leagues that are in tier 1. 
            By cleaning the data, we can focus on the data that we want. It help us to analyze the information faster</p>
        <p>[Show the head of your cleaned DataFrame.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Univariate Analysis</h2>
        <p>[Include a plotly plot that displays the distribution of a single column.]</p>
        <p>[Explain the plot, describing and interpreting any trends present.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Bivariate Analysis</h2>
        <p>[Embed a plotly plot that displays the relationship between two columns.]</p>
        <p>[Explain the plot, describing and interpreting any trends present.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Interesting Aggregates</h2>
        <p>[Embed a grouped table or pivot table in your website and explain its significance.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Assessment of Missingness</h2>
        <h3>NMAR Analysis</h3>
        <p>[State whether you believe there is a column in your dataset that is NMAR. Explain your reasoning and any additional data you might want to obtain.]</p>

        <h3>Missingness Dependency</h3>
        <p>[Present and interpret the results of your missingness permutation tests with respect to your data and question. Embed a plotly plot related to your missingness exploration.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
        <h3>Hypothesis Test</h3>
        <p>Hypothesis Testing: Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the average game length between tier 1 leagues in League of Legends. 
            Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant difference in the average game lengths between tier 1 leagues in League of Legends. 
            Test statistic: T-test Significance level: 0.05 P-value: 3.1489400690188618e-24 The T test is a good choice for this question because we are comparing 
            the means of groups. We choose 0.05 as our significant level is because we don’t have that much evidence to reject this null hypothesis.
            We see that there is a significant difference in average game duration between different regions.</p>
        <p>[Optional: Embed a visualization related to your hypothesis test.]</p>
