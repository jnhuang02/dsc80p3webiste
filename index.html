    <h1>Data Analysis Report</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction and Question Identification</h2>
        <p> Our project chooses the data of League of Legend Competitive Matches. This data contains information of players and teams from League of Legends competitive matches. 
            The question that we are interested in is does the average game duration differ significantly between different competitive regions in tier-one professional leagues in 2022? 
            The reader of the website should pay attention to this question because the game duration is important for implementing strategies. 
            Understanding the difference lets people make a more effective decision toward the games.
            There are 149400 rows and 123 columns in this dataset, and columns that are relevant to our questions are ‘gameid’, ‘gamelength’, ‘league’. 
            The gameid column represents the unique identifier to each game. The gamelength column represents how long the game takes. The league in which the game was played.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>We clean the data by only taking a specific list of leagues, since our analysis only wants the leagues that are in tier 1, which is 'LCK', 'LPL', 'LEC', 'LCS', 'PCS', 'VCS', 'CBLOL', 'LJL', 'LLA'. 
            Since we are only looking at gamelengths and league so far, we are only going to keep those two columns. GameID is also important. We notice that the gamelength for every single player in the same game is the same, which makes it redundent and repetivtive to keep repeating the same time for every player
            in the game. Therefore it's useful to only keep one unique gameid at a time.</p>
        <pre>| gameid           |   gamelength | league   |
|:-----------------|-------------:|:---------|
| 8401-8401_game_1 |         1365 | LPL      |
| 8401-8401_game_2 |         1444 | LPL      |
| 8402-8402_game_1 |         1893 | LPL      |
| 8402-8402_game_2 |         2271 | LPL      |
| 8402-8402_game_3 |         1900 | LPL      |</pre>

        <h2>Univariate Analysis</h2>
        <p><iframe src="plot1.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe></p>
        <p>The distribution of the game duration for competitive league matches looks to be uniform as it seems to be in a bell shaped form.
        This suggests that nothing unusual may come out of the lengths of the games, as there is nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Bivariate Analysis</h2>
        <iframe src="plot2.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
        <p>As seen here, the distribution of the gamelengths of the leagues do vary, which suggest that there could potentially be significant difference
        in the gamelengths that each league has.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Interesting Aggregates</h2>
         <iframe src="fig1.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
        <p>This outlines the stats of all the maximum, minimum, standard deviation, variance, etc, of the game durations of each tier 1 league. From there
        we can deduce which leagues stand out from the rest which can better help accept or reject the null hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Assessment of Missingness</h2>
        <h3>NMAR Analysis</h3>
        <p>[State whether you believe there is a column in your dataset that is NMAR. Explain your reasoning and any additional data you might want to obtain.]</p>

        <h3>Missingness Dependency</h3>
        <p>[Present and interpret the results of your missingness permutation tests with respect to your data and question. Embed a plotly plot related to your missingness exploration.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
        <h3>Hypothesis Test</h3>
        <p>Hypothesis Testing: Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the average game length between tier 1 leagues in League of Legends. 
            Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant difference in the average game lengths between tier 1 leagues in League of Legends. 
            Test statistic: T-test Significance level: 0.05 P-value: 3.1489400690188618e-24 The T test is a good choice for this question because we are comparing 
            the means of groups. We choose 0.05 as our significant level is because we don’t have that much evidence to reject this null hypothesis.
            We see that there is a significant difference in average game duration between different regions.</p>
        <p>[Optional: Embed a visualization related to your hypothesis test.]</p>
